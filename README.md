## Technology Stack & Architecture
This project is a testament to robust, modern web development practices built on a lean, efficient stack:

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS & `particles.min.js` for interactive backgrounds).
*   **Content Management:** Flat-file JSON for dynamic project and skill data.
*   **Version Control:** Git
*   **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD):** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
This portfolio operates as a static site, meaning its content is pre-rendered and served directly to the user. Dynamic elements like skills and projects are loaded client-side from local JSON files, eliminating the need for a traditional backend database. The architecture focuses on rapid delivery and maintainability via an automated deployment pipeline.
